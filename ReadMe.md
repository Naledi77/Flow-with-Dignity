Flow with Dignity

Naledi Mofokeng - ST10451076

Project Overview
Flow with Dignity is a non-profit organization founded in 2024 by Naledi Mofokeng, to help young girls in schools who cant afford sanitary pads.The orgaisation started  as a small initiative in local schools and grew through donations and community, and it now now helps women who cant afford sanitary pads as well in the community.

The aim of Flow with Dignity is to make sure no girl miss out on her education, opportunities and confidence simply because of her menstrual cycle. We believe that periods should never be a reason for shame, silence, or isolation. Menstruation is a natural part of life, and every girl deserves access to the products, support, and dignity she needs to go about her day ,including attending school  without fear or discomfort. By providing sanitary pads and education, we’re working to break the stigma and build a future where no girl is held back by something so normal.
